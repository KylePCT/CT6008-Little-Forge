Little Forge is a non-linear life simulation game which enables the player to repair a broken forge and turn their own village into the most efficient ingot production area ever seen! The game is designed to be focused around a wholesome experience where the player assumes the role of a customisable character inside of a village of various exciting, disturbing and engaging personalities; how the player interacts with them during the game is entirely their choice!

This project was created as a final year project for Team Burnwhite at the University of Gloucestershire.
